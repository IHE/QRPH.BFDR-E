(e.g., concept not provided by required code system).<br/><br/>**Usage Notes**: This flavor and its specializations are most commonly used with the CD datatype and its flavors. However, it may apply to \\*any\\* datatype where the constraints of the type are tighter than can be conveyed. For example, a PQ that is for a true measured amount whose units are not supported in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT, etc.<br/><br/>With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary binding has a coding strength of CNE. By definition, all local codes and original text are part of the value set if the coding strength is CWE.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/structuredefinition-wg","valueCode":"pher"}],"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/vr-common-library/ValueSet/ValueSet-certifier-types-vr","version":"1.1.0","name":"ValueSetCertifierTypesVitalRecords","title":"ValueSet - Certifier Types - Vital Records","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2022-08-02T13:21:04+00:00","publisher":"HL7 International / Public Health","contact":[{"name":"HL7 International / Public Health","telecom":[{"system":"url","value":"http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/pher"}]}],"description":"This ValueSet contains codes to represent the type of certifier (Medical Examiner/Coroner, Certifying physician, etc.)\nThe MDI ValueSet - Certifier Types artifact overlaps with the VRDR Certifier Types VS artifact.","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"urn:iso:std:iso:3166","code":"US","display":"United States of America"}],"text":"United States of America"}],"copyright":"This value set includes content from SNOMED CT, which is copyright Â© 2002+ International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), and distributed by agreement between IHTSDO and HL7.
